## Oli Saxon - Professional portfolio

# My first foray into coding my own portfolio page.

This repo is a work in progress and will showcase my hard skills as a developer as I progress through a coding boot camp with Manchester Univeristy.

# Technology and resources used

The page is been built using HTML and CSS with a focus on semantic HTML tags and CSS flex-box layouts. I've incorporated responsive elements in the navigation bar and a fixed position effect on the main project image to add some interest to the page. The flex-box layout design paired with media queries ensures the page is accessible on all devies i.e. desktop, mobile or tablet.

# Challenges

I found it challenging to recreate my wireframe design onto a web browser; a lot of trial and error eventually led me to this result and overall I'm pleased with the outcome and the aesthetic.

I hope to build on the page as my skills and knowledge improves throughout my course.
